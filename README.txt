UNFINISHED//UNTESTED

In our world, every serviceable thermostat needs at least four setpoints.
Thermostatically controlled loads comprise roughly 50% of the overall electricity demand in the United States (Energy Information Administration, ‘‘Residential energy consumption survey,’’ U.S. Dept. Energy, Washington, DC, Tech. Rep., 2001.)
We can't make environmentally conscious choices unless we're empowered to compromise. The quad-setpoint thermostat encourages and teaches us to compromise. My design goes a step further and embraces the human sleep/wake cycle to really nail down desired functionality.

A traditional thermostat works by establishing a single setpoint that the HVAC system works with bidirectionally: obsessively heating during the night and cooling during the day.

A dual-setpoint thermostat allows you to set an upper and lower boundary, to compromise with nature: the sun and the seasons.
This range should be as wide as the range you and your guests are comfortable with. If the temperature indoors breaks that range, the HVAC will enable to condition the air appropriately.

A quad-setpoint thermostat allows you to have "active" and "relaxed" modes to compromise with your schedule.
We're on the go, but especially in extreme temperatures nobody wants to come home to a completely frigid or uncooled home or office.
Turning it off is just plain untenable for some.
At the same time, setting the thermostat too aggressively while away drives up electricity costs without improving utility.
Configure your passive mode such that you can live with the temperature range upon arrival while remaining environmentally conscious.
Upon getting home, just slap the device into active mode (single-button) and your HVAC will cool or warm back to your more specific, comfortable temperature range.

My hex-setpoint thermostat allows you to compromise with your own body.

It doesn't need to be like that while I'm awake. Frankly in Florida, that would be quite ridiculous. We need to go back to the drawing board and compromise again. 
I'd prefer to keep it between 19 and 23.5 while I'm awake, I just need it a bit cooler at night.
And so our design adds a third mode with two more setpoints for nighttime use: plain and simple.

Now do you understand why we need six setpoints?

//TODO add programmable time-of-day defaults to be overridden by the triple-mode overrides.
